# Pokemon Game

This project is a pokemon style game, it was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with the aim of improving my knowledge of the JavaScript language. The game maps were built using the Tiled tool. The Howler.js audio javascript library and the GSAP animation javascript library were also used.
In the game you can walk around the map, interact with NPCs and enter pokemon battles.
